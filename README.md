# Ph-eEquilibriation
This repository contains the files and codes related to the phonon-electron equilibriation problem that I am pursuing presently as MS Thesis at TIFR, Colaba with Dr Rajdeep Sensarma in the COViD-19 affected Fall-2020, Spring-2021 semesters. We start with a lattice of coupled Electrons and Phonons , with some of the electrons initially excited to high energy states and study how it thermalises using Non-Equilibrium Field Theory.
